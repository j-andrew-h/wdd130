                    Welcome to Destiny 2 Info, a simple website to gain basic information that you need for getting started with the game. For those who are new to Destiny 2, it is a MMO FPS developed by Bungie that has seen over 6 years of content created for it. Due to this, many systems that did not exist initially are now in the game and the story has become expansive, so having a single place to understand these topics is why we are here. To get started, please go to either the page on the story, which will provide a brief explanantion of the story up to the start of the Lightfall campaign, the current content released. Or you can go into buildcrafting, which will help to explain the mechanics that you can use to create the perfect guardian.
