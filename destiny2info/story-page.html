            The story begins in Destiny 1, where the Guardians fight against various alien races that threaten the Last City, the last bastion of humanity on Earth. The Guardians also explore the secrets of the Traveler and its ancient enemies, such as the Vex, a race of time-traveling machines, and the Hive, a horde of undead creatures that worship the Darkness. The Guardians face off against powerful foes such as Crota, the son of Oryx, the Taken King, who invades the solar system with his army of corrupted beings; Atheon, the leader of the Vex in the Vault of Glass, a mysterious realm outside of time; and Skolas, a rebel Fallen leader who tries to unite his people under his banner.

            The story continues in Destiny 2, where the Guardians lose their connection to the Traveler after a surprise attack by Ghaul, the leader of the Red Legion, a faction of the Cabal, a militaristic empire. The Guardians must reclaim their Light and fight back against Ghaul and his forces, while also dealing with other threats such as Calus, the exiled emperor of the Cabal who invites them to his Leviathan ship; Panoptes, a Vex mind that tries to manipulate reality in the Infinite Forest, a simulation engine on Mercury; Xol, a Worm God of the Hive that awakens on Mars; and Riven, a Taken Ahamkara, a wish-granting dragon that corrupts the Dreaming City, a sacred place for the Awoken race.

            The story expands in Destiny 2: Forsaken, where the Guardians seek revenge for the death of Cayde-6, a beloved Vanguard leader who was killed by Uldren Sov, the prince of the Awoken who was manipulated by Riven. The Guardians hunt down Uldren and his Scorned Barons in the Tangled Shore, a lawless region in the Reef. They also discover the secrets of the Dreaming City and its curse cycle, which is caused by Riven's last wish and Savathun, Oryx's sister and the Witch Queen of the Hive. The Guardians also face new challenges such as Siviks, a Fallen black marketeer who steals powerful weapons from the Black Armory; The Drifter, a rogue Lightbearer who runs a dangerous game called Gambit; and Gahlran, a Cabal warlord who is corrupted by an artifact from Calus.

The Guardians must confront their fears and nightmares while also dealing with new enemies such as Hashladun, a daughter of Crota who seeks to resurrect her father; The Undying Mind, a Vex mind that tries to alter the timeline in favor of the Darkness; and The Sanctified Mind, a Vex mind that has integrated with a pyramid ship in the Garden of Salvation.
