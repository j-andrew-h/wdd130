                The first part you should understand of buildcrafting is the armor mods that are provided, as they are what will allow you to survive and deal enough damage for end game content. 
            </p>
            <p>The armor mods are divided into 3 main categories, orb generation, armor charge, and </p>
            <p>Orb generation mods will do exactly what they say, generated orbs of light. These orbs are the main activating force for your other mods. When you decide what weapons you will be using, pick mods that compliment those weapons and the attack method you are using, either your grenades, melees, or class ability.</p>
            <p>Armor charge mods are what you will use the orbs of light to gain increased survivability. They fall under two types, decay and single use. The decay type will provide an improvement to the specified stat or damage type for a certain length of time, and then removing one of your armor charges. The other kind are single use, which donn't activate until you have a certain amount of armor charges, then provide you with the benefit. These can provide greater benefit, but are harder to obtain and start your combos.</p>
            <p>The last kind are support mods, these are mods that improve other aspects of your character, like ammo finding, reload speed, or other effects.</p>
            <p>The effective use of all three of these mods allow you to survive and cause mass destruction</p>
