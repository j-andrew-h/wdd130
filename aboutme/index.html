    <h2>Andrew</h2>
    <p>Hello all, my name is Joseph, although I go by my middle name Andrew. I'm currently studying for my Applied Technology degree. I'm an avid gamer and especially enjoy playing a game called Destiny.  </p>
    <p>I'm hoping to be able to develop the skills to develop applications, with luck games. So with this degree and studying in web design as well, I'm hoping to be able to gain the skills needed to not only create the backend for the applications, but also learn how to create art on the computer using the tools available. Of course, this is all subject to change as the field of computer science is very broad!</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints my whole life (so 23 years), and just recently returned from serving a mission in Paraguay.</p>
